SysPolicyParameters_SelectAllGroup=The types of organizations to which a policy can be associated. Organizations can have multiple layers. You might have legal entities, cost centers, regions, departments, and other organizational units. These must first be defined before they can be displayed as an organization type in the Organization types field.
 ;Description text for the SelectAllGroup control on the SysPolicyParameters form
SysPolicyParameters_NavTreeGrp=The types of policy rules that can be defined for each policy-related activity. The policy rule types displayed in this area differ, depending on the type of policy being created. There are many policy rule types that provide a wide variety of business-related rule enforcement, such as spending limits, invoice and expense auditing, and control of procurement activities.
 ;Description text for the NavTreeGrp control on the SysPolicyParameters form
SysPolicyParameters_SelectedListGroup=For each policy rule type, define the order in which the policy rule type should be resolved. This enables you to override the default order of precedence defined for all policy rules. Using the Purchasing policy rule types as an example, suppose you define the order of precedence for catalog policy rules so that Department catalog policy rules take precedence over Company catalog policy rules. When an employee logs on to the shopping site and begins to shop, any catalog policy rule defined for the department that they belong to will take precedence over any catalog policy rule defined for the company that they belong to. For audit policies only: Although you must select at least one organization type in order to use audit policies, you do not have to change the order of precedence for those organization types. When an audit policy is run, all rules within that policy are run. The system does not select which audit policy rules to run based on the order of precedence.
