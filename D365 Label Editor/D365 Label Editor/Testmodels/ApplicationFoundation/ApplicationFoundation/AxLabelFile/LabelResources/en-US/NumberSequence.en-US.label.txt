CacheCandidateRuleDescription=Check if any number sequence is possible to use cache capability.
 ;Cache candidate rule description
CacheCandidateRuleMessage=Non-continuous number sequences are resulting in database lookups and are not using the cache capabilities on the AOS.
 ;Cache candidate rule message
CacheCandidateRuleRecommendation=For each non-continuous number sequence, activate preallocation at number sequence form of Organization administration.

CleanupIntervalRuleDescription=Check if continuous number sequence has cleanup interval.
 ;Cleanup interval rule description
CleanupIntervalRuleMessage=Some number sequences which are set as Continuous and marked for Cleanup do not have a cleanup interval set, which forces a cleanup every time a number sequence value is generated.
 ;Cleanup interval rule message
CleanupIntervalRuleRecommendation=For each continuous number sequence set Cleanup to Yes, specify a number of hours for the Cleanup interval (default is 24.) Use the number sequence form at Organization administration.
 ;Cleanup interval rule recommendation
FullyUsedRuleDescription=Check if a number sequence has no more available values
 ;Fully used rule description
FullyUsedRuleMessage=One or more number sequences have no more available values.
 ;Fully used rule message
FullyUsedRuleRecommendation=Increase the highest value setting for the number sequence at number sequence form of Organization administration.
 ;Fully used rule recommendation
UsageRuleDescription=Check if a number sequence has enough available numbers.
 ;Usage rule description
UsageRuleMessage=We recommend maintaining a buffer of available numbers for each number sequence of greater than 20% to prevent running out in production during peak workloads. Importance: If a number sequence is exhausted and has no more numbers to assign, a work stoppage may result. For example, if you run out of Sales Order numbers, no new sales orders can be created until the situation is corrected.
 ;Usage rule message
UsageRuleRecommendation=Maintain an available numbers buffer for each number sequence of more than 20%. This can be achieved by increasing the upper limit of the number sequence or by running a manual cleanup of sequences marked as continuous. Number sequences can be managed in the number sequence form of Organization administration.
