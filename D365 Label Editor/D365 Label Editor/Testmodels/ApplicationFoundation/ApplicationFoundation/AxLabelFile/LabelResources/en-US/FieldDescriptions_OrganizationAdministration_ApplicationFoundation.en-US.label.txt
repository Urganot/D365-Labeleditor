UnitOfMeasure_Roles_M_editIsBaseUnit=A selected option indicates that the unit of measure is defined as the base unit within the unit's unit class. The base unit helps streamline the conversion setup for a unit of measure. When a base unit is defined within a unit class, the number of conversion rules between units of measure in the class can be limited. For example, you have a conversion rule that enables conversion from milliliters to liters and another conversion rule that enables conversion from liters to gallons. If you have specified liters as the base unit in the Liquid volume unit class, you can convert from gallons to milliliters without a conversion rule between these two units.
